# Graphing the English Language

## About

This porject started as a scarpping project which later turn into a search to understand language better.
If every word is connected to other word in meaning, such as synonyms. Then:

> Is there a way to start from one word and reach it's antonym only by traverzing it synonyms? 

All of there question led me to see if I could make a complete graph o the english laguage on one file

And here it is:
