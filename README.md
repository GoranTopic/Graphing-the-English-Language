# Graphing the English Language

## About

This project originally started as a scrapping challenge which later turn into a search to understand language better. 

As I was, scrapping dictionaries for word and their definitions, I notices that every word had synonyms; Words that are very close in meaning.

Then I occurred to me. 

Can we think of all of the English language as set of words in a graph connected by their meaning to each other? 

Would every word be connected?

If so, words that are farther apart in meaning to each other would be have a longer paths.

While word that are interchangeable or very close in meaning will have a shorter path.

If we could graph all of the words in the English language and connected them by meaning this would give us the ability not only to know if two word are synonyms, but how far away are they to each other.

I would give us the ability to see the way the meaning sifts as we get follow th path from one word to an other. 

Well, this I exactly what I did.

#### Behold the graph of all English words:

## Clusters 

If you take your time to peruse the image you would find that a lot of the words are segregated in clusters.

This clusters would often connect with each other with one word. 

This are some of the clusters that I have found:

> The Isles of Crazy
!['the isles of crazy.png'](assets/the\ isles\ of\ crazy.png)

> The Isles of Stupid
!['the isles of stupid.png'](assets/the\ isles\ of\ stupid.png)


> The Isles of Sad
!['the isles of sad.png'](assets/the\ isles\ of\ sad.png)
